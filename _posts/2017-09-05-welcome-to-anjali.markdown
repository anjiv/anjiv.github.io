Fine, I’ll admit it: I’m Anjali Vijay .

I’m a developer living in Pune,India. I like it here because it’s pretty moderate climate here and it is Awesome !!

You can find me [on Twitter][twitter], [on GitHub][github].

I grew up in Rajasthan, India, which really is lovely, even though it's too cold in Winters and at the same time too warm in Summers.

Want to chat? Feel free to [email][mail] me, or if you have any question, can leave a mail.
